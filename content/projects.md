### Improving Incident Response of the American Red Cross in the Greater Chicago Area by Using Text Classification of Posts From Twitter

[==> See this link for a PDF presentation <==](/static/IPRO%20-%20Improving%20Incident%20Response%20of%20the%20American%20Red%20Cross%20in%20the%20Greater%20Chicago%20Area%20by%20Using%20Text%20Classification%20of%20Posts%20From%20Twitter.pdf)

#### Summary

This project developed an innovative tool to enhance the American Red Cross’s emergency response by leveraging social media data, specifically by mining and classifying tweets related to disasters in the Chicago area. By integrating a robust Twitter scraper that filters posts based on keywords and geolocation with a suite of machine learning models—including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and notably Linear Support Vector Classification—the team demonstrated an effective way to sift through vast amounts of social media content. This approach enables the rapid identification of critical incidents such as house fires and floods, significantly reducing the need for manual data review.

The analysis revealed that while the automated system is promising—accurately detecting disaster-related tweets and providing a streamlined process for incident reporting—there is still room for improvement. Future enhancements, such as deeper integration of the scraper with the classifier and the implementation of active learning strategies, could further refine accuracy and reduce false positives. Overall, this project lays a strong foundation for harnessing real-time social media data to support timely and informed emergency response efforts, paving the way for smarter, data-driven disaster management solutions.
