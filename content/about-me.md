Hello! Welcome to Henry Post's (my!) public website.

![](/static/headshot.png)

Here I hope to publish my resume, projects, and other information about myself.

I used to pay for a domain name, but I've since decided that it's not worth the cost. I'm happy to host this site on GitHub Pages for free.

My old site used to be at [henrypost.net](https://henrypost.net), but I've since let the domain expire.

I may host other infrastructure on that domain, but for now, this is my main site.

For trust's sake, here are my public SSH keys:

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIABXUrgDabknc+CVDcdyGIUP9yXzrR0EEnTijYNVTfKr melty@ubuntu-slimdragon
```

I hope you enjoy your stay!
