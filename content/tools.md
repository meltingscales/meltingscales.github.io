# Tools

A list of tools I use.

## Programming

- python: general purpose language
  - conda/poetry/uv/pipenv/pip - package managers. prefer uv for speed/simplicity.
  - pil/pillow: image processing library
  - numpy: numerical computing library
  - pandas: xlsx/csv manipulation library
  - matplotlib: data visualization library
- rust: faster than python.
- bash: scripting language
- just: very good build tool

## OS

i highly recommend never using windows, for many, many reasons

- ubuntu - server OS
- nixos - server/desktop OS
- cachyOS - easy arch based OS, fast
- TrueNAS CORE - freebsd based NAS OS that uses ZFS, ZFS is superior for use as a NAS for many reasons

## Hardware

I run various cheap laptops and a few HEPC (High-End Personal Computer) setups.
Only Linux, except for a Windows computer I use for piano playing.
