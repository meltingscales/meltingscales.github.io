This album, UNKILLABLE ANGEL by Ada Rook, rocks.

It's excellent.

That's it. That's the whole review. Go listen to it.

UPDATE 05/02/2025:

This album means a lot to me. As someone who feels like a kid stuck in an adult's body sometimes, this album talks about that.

It talks about how early trauma can warp and distort you, and make you act out constantly.

It also talks about the raw joy that comes from being a kid, and how it can feel lost sometimes as an adult.

I still love minecraft and teaching/learning progrmaming, so that's a big joy in my life that I'm grateful for.
