I've been having a lot more dreams about fractals.

I think that biology is obviously fractal, just go look at a sunflower or a brain.

But computing has long been non-fractal. I only think the fractal nature of information processing is more obvious because LLMs and AI allow us to organically "grow" code as one would grow a sunflower.

Yeah, it's really weird. But a good thing. It's like we're growing a new kind of organism made entirely out of data.

EDIT:

Like. Zipf's law. What else? The mandelbrot and julia sets? The golden ratio? Fluid dynamics and chaos theory? The Fibonacci sequence? The prime number spirals? -1/12? The logistic map bifurcation diagram as it relates to bunny population growth? Finite state machines like those in the book "A new kind of math" by Stephen Wolfram.

It makes me think about all the edges of human experience - death, birth, states of extreme consciousness like sleep or meditation.

Is the universe just self-similar by nature? Is the universe itself a fractal? If all matter used to be a single point, it sure makes sense. Not like it's magic or anything. Sunflowers are the way they are because of self-similarity, so why shouldn't the rest of the universe be too?
