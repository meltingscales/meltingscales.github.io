I've been having a lot more dreams about fractals.

I think that biology is obviously fractal, just go look at a sunflower or a brain.

But computing has long been non-fractal. I only think the fractal nature of information processing is more obvious because LLMs and AI allow us to organically "grow" code as one would grow a sunflower.

Yeah, it's really weird. But a good thing. It's like we're growing a new kind of organism made entirely out of data.
