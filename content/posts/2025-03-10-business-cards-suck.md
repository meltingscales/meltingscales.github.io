Okay. So...business cards suck! They're annoying, expensive to get printed, and get outdated quickly. I've been to so many networking events where I've gotten a stack of business cards, only to throw them away a few weeks later.

Let's fix it with technology!

3 years ago, in 2022, I made a ReactJS package to render business cards in HTML:

<https://github.com/meltingscales/react-business-card-hfbp?tab=readme-ov-file>

I used it on my old ReactJS public site:

<https://github.com/meltingscales/henrypost.net/>

I'm switching to Markdown for my personal site, so I'm going to make raw HTML versions of my business cards and deeplink them.

This means you can just edit this post to change my business card. No more expensive printing!

To print, I recommend zooming in on your browser and taking a screenshot. You can also print to PDF. Then, you can email the PDF to someone or print it out. You can either resize it yourself, or the printing company will resize it for you.

To change aspect ratio, you can edit the CSS in the HTML file. You can also edit the ReactJS package to change the aspect ratio.
