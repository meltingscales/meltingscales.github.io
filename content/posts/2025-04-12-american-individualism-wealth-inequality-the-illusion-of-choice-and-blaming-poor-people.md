A poorer black friend of mine, let's call him "M", with friends in O-Block (a dangerous south suburb/flat complex), recently described some interesting concepts to me.

- Poor people suffer orders of magnitudes more than wealthy people.
- Most wealthy people operate on autopilot and lead far more stable and peaceful lives than very poor people.
- The world is an unfair place.

1. White people love saying slurs for some strange reason (Extreme entitlement, lack of introspection)
2. American individualism is bad for the collective, good for the individual, and explains the phenomenon of entitled social interactions like "Karens" ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66XK0PYabSs))
3. Racism is a learned behavior and can be inherited

An example: When you grow up with a $500,000 inheritance in the suburbs, and your father watches Fox news and makes fun of the "retarded protestors" that are angry about how George Floyd was murdered, you might think it's hilarious and learn that it's a form of humor.

I don't know if I'm making a strawman up, but I'm certain that this has happened at least once. And I'm sure it does affect society.

I know that growing up on 4chan, a very racist imageboard, made my teenage self racist for a while. I've mostly un-learned it.

My friend "M" described how his family was very poor, and that instills a specific compulsive form of protective behavior in his parents, and they robbed him of opportunity through fear and economic insecurity.

I don't think "blame his parents" is useful here, because his parents were always going to be poor. There is nothing that they could have likely done to change the outcome of their lives.

Being homeless and poor causes you to go through extreme stress, and things like planning, doing taxes, and studying for school become nearly impossible.

If you are poor, often times, **there is no real choice. You just suffer.**

As a homeless person, you live with a 3-day mental window and are assaulted, attacked, raped, stolen from, beaten up, spit on, but largely, **ignored or treated poorly by every stranger you meet**. This destroys one's will to go on and your dignity. You starve slowly, cannot store food or toiletries, cannot shower, cannot obtain a job, and so many other insanely hard problems.

**Universal Basic Income** will help alleviate this problem. I hope to god this, and **ranked-choice voting** come to the USA as soon as possible.

I'm FUCKING SICK of hearing about more bodies hitting the pavement due to gun violence, alcoholism, opioids like fent/heroin, and just the heavy neutron-star weight of depression that comes with extreme poverty.

UBI would of course, create some new issues:

- ("Laziness? Aren't we already all workaholics? We worship corporations like gods, and they DEMAND we grovel lest we lose our jobs and end up homeless!")
- Lying to get double UBI (As if the federal government is competent enough to actually track the distribution of UBI - for god's sake, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the OCC, had its emails breached 3 days ago!)
- The fear of "welfare queens" will rage, sadly, likely spread through right wing media outlets
- `Oh god no! People might work less! Whatever shall we do!` /s
- Corporations would likely oppose it due to their addiction to being slave-drivers for the American people.

But it would solve far more issues, in my opinion:

- A safety net for ALL AMERICANS
- Less homelessness: Homeless people would either get flats, live together, or rent hotels to be able to take showers and rest from the blistering sun/freezing cold
- Food security: Less food deserts
- Industries would crop up in response to UBI: This means **JOB CREATION** ACROSS ALL SOCIAL CLASSES!

There's a misconception about the economy. "Giving away free money will cause laziness" - No, actually! It encourages movement. The economy is a living network of blood vessels. LACK OF FLOW OF MONEY is unhealthy! UBI represents A FLOW OF MONEY! It will stimulate the economy!

Truly, I looked up to Tony Stark as a kid. I have a god complex, unfortunately. I can't legislate shit. I'm just a 27 year old cybersecurity expert that gets bothered by too much. But I can vent in my personal blog `>:3c`

I think that UBI, humanoid robot deployments across the USA, addiction research centers, and FREE SCHOOLING will solve many issues.
