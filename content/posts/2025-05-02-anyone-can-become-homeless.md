I'm having this weird, creeping feeling of dread as I read more news.

I'm middle class. I make a decent salary. I own a home and have a mortgage.

But... I could become homeless, if I make enough mistakes in my life.

That's pretty scary. I think America's leaders need to actually try to support homeless people. Truly they represent an underclass with no voice.
