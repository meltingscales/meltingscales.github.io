This is a stub, a TODO item for myself. I want to make a list of my fave games, minecraft modpacks, music, movies, and books.

Another TODO would be to pull data from my Bandcamp and just dump it here.

<!-- DONE! Another TODO is to make a webring, since I've entirely ditched social media. It'd be neat to have a real RSS feed that I control
and avoid getting oneshotted by bots and `recommendation_watchnext.serve()`...-->
