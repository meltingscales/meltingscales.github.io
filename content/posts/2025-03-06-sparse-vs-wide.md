I recently read an interesting article about a neural network that, instead of artificial neurons, has logic gates.

<https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/?hn>

The paper described its neural network as "sparse", and this made me want to ask ChatGPT "Why does this paper describe logic-gate networks as sparse?"

I didn't realize this really important fact:

In "Deep Neural Networks", they're called "Deep" because it's a 2D matrix of nodes "neurons" that are FULLY CONNECTED to every single output in the previous layer.

So, for DNNs, this means that, a 2d matrix ("layer") of 8x8 neurons (64), every single neuron in the next layer receives 64 individual inputs - 1 for each neuron in the previous layer.

For logic gate-based networks, they are NOT fully connected at all - each logic gate can only receive 1 or 2 inputs from the previous layer.

My intuition tells me that this probably makes these networks far easier to optimize.
