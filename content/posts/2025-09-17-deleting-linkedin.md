I just deleted my LinkedIn account. It feels fantastic to be rid of it. I've gotten rid of my Facebook account as well.

About 3 times a week, I get calls from recruiters and cold calls from companies I've never heard of. I'm hoping that entirely ceases now.

Yeah...that's kind of it. I'm going to post here and try to do decentralized microblogging. I'm sick of corporations pushing their constant stream of mildly stimulating 10-second videos down my throat.

Ever since ditching Facebook, I have had so much internal peace. I'm free from an IV drip of political outrage and AI garbage. I focus on my hobbies, the gym, and real-life interactions with people.

Now my next task is to touch up my resume page a bit and just make updated business cards.
