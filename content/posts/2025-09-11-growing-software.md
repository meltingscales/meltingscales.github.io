I host self-hosted AI models on a dual-CPU desktop that has a 24GB AMD GPU. It's neat but surprisingly slow and can't handle models whose .gguf files are larger than like, 9GB.

Despite this limitation, I was able to make a toy demo where I use an AI model to continually update and edit a Git repo.

I've learned that "Aider" is a neat, young, and somewhat buggy AI coding tool to rival Claude's CLI.

I started paying $20/mo for Claude's CLI + AI web model, and it's pretty good! It's only a tiny bit better than ChatGippity.

I've also menat to check out "opencode", which is a `claude` CLI clone just like `aider`.

It's really cool to see the ability to organically "grow" software be achieved, by "seeding" it with written directions such as those seen here:

It's really sad to see how...I don't know. Annoying? Spammy? AI Slop-y? The text gets sometimes when you let an AI agent just do its thing forever? But I mean...The game works! I spent minimal time coding it myself. I don't even know Rust!

I'm really excited to see how automated code generation continues to...take off. It's really something.
