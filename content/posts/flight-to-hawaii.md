Going to see a friend from my childhood, a good friend of my late mom - Jet Dee. Can't wait.

Will update this blog more after I land.

Update: It was pretty good. Been awake for 36 hours...and caught the Plymouth Brockton bus
with about 30 seconds to spare.

I'll probably update this later... I would just ramble about something random if I wrote
more.

What I really should do is figure out how to make the functionality of "view only post
tagged with X". I might need to ask David K the best way to do this.
