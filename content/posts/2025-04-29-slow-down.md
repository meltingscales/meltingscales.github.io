Corporate america seems addicted to acceleration and causing burnout.

I recently read a Microsoft article about AI, about "Frontier Firms".

I think America needs to slow down.

When I read Microsoft's article about "Frontier Firms", I just fear that companies will use this as an excuse to fire workers and replace them with AI agents, and then over-work existing "high performing" employees.
