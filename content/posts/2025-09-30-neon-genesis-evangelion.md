I really like Neon Genesis Evangelion. I think it's highly compatible with both Buddhism and Judaism.

It's a neat anime whose theme of "death = unification" is something that I don't see a lot of modern media exploring.

I don't think passing away is always a bad thing. It can definitely be a release from suffering.

I definitely think life is worth living and think suicide is often a bad thing, but I support the concept of MAID or euthanasia for those whose quality of life is awful. It makes me think about my late mom: In her last months, she suffered so much.
