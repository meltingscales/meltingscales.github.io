I recently read that the police can court order Ring to disclose my private camera footage.

In addition to that, it probably does free license plate scans for cops, and might assist ICE or something. Or sell me more crap on Amazon?
So... who knows what they do with it! The data is in Ring's cloud. I have no clue what they do with it, and that bugs me.

So, I immediately nuked my entire Ring setup (factory reset) and am going to pawn it immediately to buy a replacement.

I'm going to set up my own self-hosted stack to avoid spookiness being embedded within a service I already pay $99/yr for, which is ridiculous.

I hope to have a useful stack setup below pretty soon :)
