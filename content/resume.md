## Summary

I'm an accomplished security and application engineering professional with a proven record of delivering measurable business outcomes. 

As Lead Application Security Engineer at Bayview Asset Management, I spearheaded secure coding training and vulnerability remediation, and implemented automation solutions that provided C-suite executives with critical metrics. We achieved a 60% reduction in software risk within a year. 

My hands-on leadership in 0-day fixes and vulnerability remediation ensured effective management of both immediate threats and long-term risks.

At U.S. Bank, I advanced from Security Analyst to Senior Security Engineer and Assistant Vice President. 

I played a key role in modernizing development tooling, integrating robust code scanning pipelines, and improving legacy application security through modern frameworks like Spring Boot and container orchestration with Kubernetes and Helm.

By streamlining processes and fostering cross-functional collaboration, I enhanced operational efficiency and compliance, directly impacting risk management and security strategy.

My academic foundation in cybersecurity is complemented by diverse projects, from [fire disaster data analysis](/static/IPRO%20-%20Improving%20Incident%20Response%20of%20the%20American%20Red%20Cross%20in%20the%20Greater%20Chicago%20Area%20by%20Using%20Text%20Classification%20of%20Posts%20From%20Twitter.pdf) to innovative cost-saving technology solutions. I am committed to writing clear, reusable, and well-documented code, and am passionate about teaching and technical leadership. My blend of business insight and technical expertise makes me a valuable asset to organizations focused on mitigating risk and driving operational excellence.

Throughout my education and career at U.S. Bank and Bayview, I have prioritized educating others. I have taught colleagues PowerBI reporting, Python scripting, Postman usage, vulnerability remediation, and process automation.
